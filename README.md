# Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR)

## Description

The Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) project is a technology that accurately identifies license plates using CCTV feeds in real-time. This ANPR system is designed to read number plates that are written in non-standard ways, employing various font styles, designs, symbols, etc., which can be challenging for current ANPR systems to read. The project incorporates Optical Character Recognition (OCR) for text visualization of the detected number plate, enhancing its overall accuracy and efficiency.

## Features

- Real-time detection of license plates
- Accurate identification of number plates with varying font styles and designs
- Incorporates OCR for text visualization of detected number plates
- Utilizes CCTV feeds for ANPR
